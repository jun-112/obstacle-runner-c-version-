This is a small C++ program. Some antivirus software might flag it as suspicious, but it’s completely safe.
It can show false positives because it’s new, not digitally signed, and uses resource files like .ico, .rc, and .h. You can check the main code in the .cpp file yourself. Included files are the cpp code, header files, resources, and a dev file for development purposes.
You can compile it with any C++ compiler. Virus alerts are likely just false positives
